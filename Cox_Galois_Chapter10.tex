\subsection{CONSTRUCTIBLE NUMBERS}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.1}

{\it In part (a) of Example 10.1.2 we constructed the $x$-axis. In a similar way show that the $y$-axis is constructible. For each step in your construction be sure to say which of $C1,C2,P1,P2$, and $P3$ you are using.
}

\begin{proof}
Let $ \mathcal C$ be the set of constructible numbers in $\C$.

Write $C(\gamma,r)$ the circle with center $\gamma \in \C$ and radius $r$.

Starting from $ \{0,1\}$, we obtain by $C1$ the $x$-axis and by $P2$ the point $-1$ at the intersection of $C(0,1)$ with the $x$-axis, so
$$ \{-1,0,1\} \subset {\cal C}.$$
If $\alpha = -1, \beta = 1$, then $|\beta - \alpha| = 2$, so $C(-1,2)$ and $C(1,2)$ are constructible by $C2$.

Using $P3$, the intersection $C(-1,2) \cap C(1,2)=\{\delta - \delta\}$ gives the point $\delta = i\sqrt{3}$. The $y$-axis that goes through $0$ and $\delta$ is so constructible by $C1$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.2}

{\it Suppose that $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are noncolinear and consider the rays $\overrightarrow{\alpha \beta}$ and $\overrightarrow{\alpha \gamma}$ emanating from $\alpha$ that go through $\beta$ and $\gamma$ respectively. We call this the angle formed by $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$. Also assume that $\alpha, \beta,\gamma$ are constructible.
\be
\item[(a)] Prove that there is a constructible number $\delta$ with positive $y$-coordinate such that the angle formed by $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ is congruent to the angle formed by $0,1,\delta$. As in Exercise 1, each step in the construction should be justified by $C1,C2,P1,P2$, or $P3$.
\item[(b)] Prove that the claim made in Example 10.1.3 that $\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i/n}$ is constructible if and only if a regular $n$-gon can be constructed by straightedge and compass.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] $C(\alpha,1)$ is constructible by $C2$. Let $\gamma'$ the intersection point of the line $\alpha \beta$ with $C(\alpha,1)$, then $\gamma'$ is constructible by $P2$. Let $\eta$ the orthogonal projection of $\gamma'$ on the line $\alpha \beta$. Then $\eta$ is constructible with the usual construction: the circle $C(\gamma',r)$, with $r=  |\gamma' \alpha|$,  has two intersection points $\alpha,\alpha'$ with the line $\alpha \beta$, and the intersection point $\gamma'' \ne \gamma'$ of $C(\alpha,r)$ with $C(\alpha',r)$ is constructible, so is the line $\gamma' \gamma''$, and $\eta$ the intersection of the line $\gamma' \gamma''$ with the orthogonal line $\alpha \beta$. Then the cosine of the angle $(\overrightarrow{\alpha \beta},\overrightarrow{\alpha \gamma})$ is $\pm | \eta \alpha| $.

Write $\xi, \xi'$ the two intersection points of $C(0,| \eta \alpha|)$ with the $x$-axis. The  line passing trough $\xi$ and orthogonal to the $x$-axis intersect $C(0,1)$ in the point $\delta_1 $ with positive $y$-coordinate, and similarly  line passing trough $\xi'$ and orthogonal to the $x$-axis intersect $C(0,1)$ in the point $\delta_2 $ with positive $y$-coordinate, so both are constructible. Then the cosine of the angle formed by $0,1,\delta_1$ is the opposite of the cosine of the angle formed by $0,1,\delta_2$, and equal in absolute value to $ |\eta \alpha|$. So the angle formed by  $0,1,\delta_1$ or $0,1,\delta_2$ is congruent to the angle formed by $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, so we can take $\delta = \delta_1$ or $\delta = \delta_2$ such that the angle formed by  $0,1,\delta$ is congruent to the angle formed by $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, and $\delta$ is constructible.

\item[(b)] $\bullet$ If $\zeta_n$ is constructible, so are $1,\zeta_n,\ldots, \zeta_n^{n-1}$ since $\cal C$ is a subfield of $\C$ (Theorem 10.1.4), and these points are the vertices of a regular $n$-gon.

$\bullet$ Suppose that a regular $n$-gon can be constructed by straightedge and compass. Let $\beta, \gamma$ be two consecutive vertices. Then the center $\alpha$ of the $n$-gon is constructible, and the measure of the angle formed by $\alpha, \beta,\gamma$ has measure $\theta = 2\pi/n$ (see Example 10.1.3).

By part (a), we can construct $\delta$ with positive $y$-coordinate such that the angle formed by $0,1,\delta$ has the same measure $2\pi/n$. The intersection $\zeta$ of the line $0\delta$ with $C(0,1)$ is constructible, and $\arg(\zeta) = 2\pi/n, |\zeta| = 1$, so $\zeta_n = \zeta$ is constructible.
\ee
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.3}

{\it This exercise covers the details omitted in the proof of Theorem 10.1.4.
\be
\item[(a)] Let $\alpha,\beta$ be constructible numbers such that $0,\alpha,\beta$ are collinear. Prove that $\alpha+\beta$ is constructible.
\item[(b)] Let $a\in {\cal C} \cap \{x\in \R\, | \, x>0\}$. Use Figure 2 in the proof of Theorem 10.1.4 to show that $1/a$ is constructible.
\item[(c)] In the proof of Theorem 10.1.4, we showed that ${\cal C} \cap  \{x\in \R\, | \, x>0\}$ is closed under addition, mutiplication, and multiplicative inverses. Use this to prove that ${\cal C} \cap \R$ is a subfield of $\R$.
\item[(d)] Prove that the number $\beta$ pictured in (10.1) is constructible (assuming that $r$ is constructible).
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] Let $D$ be the line passing through $0,\alpha,\beta$, and $C$ the circle of radius $|\beta|$ with center $\alpha$. Then $D$ and $C$ intersect in two points, one of them being $\alpha + \beta$, which is so constructible.
\item[(b)] As $a$ is constructible, so is $ia$. We can construct the parallel to the line $1,ia$ passing through $i$. The intersection point of this parallel with the $x$-axis gives a point $d>0$. As the triangles $(0,d,i)$ and $(0,1,ia)$ are similar, $d/1 = i/ia$, so $1/a = d$ is constructible.
\item[(c)] We have proved in the text that $\cal C$ is a subgroup of $(\C,+)$, so ${\cal C} \cap \R$ is a subgroup of $(\R,+)$.

Let $a,b\in {\cal C} \cap \R$. If $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ then $a+b \in  {\cal C} \cap \R$. If $a \ne 0, b\ne 0$ then $|a| = \pm a \in {\cal C} \cap \R_+^*$, so $|ab| = |a| |b| \in  {\cal C} \cap \R_+^*$, therefore $ab =\pm |ab| \in {\cal C} \cap \R$.

Let $a \in {\cal C} \cap \R, a\ne 0$. then $| a | \in {\cal C} \cap \R_+^*$, so $1/|a| \in {\cal C} \cap \R_+^*$. Therefore $1/a = \pm 1/|a| \in {\cal C} \cap \R$.

Conclusion : ${\cal C} \cap \R$ is a subfield of $\R$.
\item[(d)] We can construct the orthogonal line $D$ to the $x$-axis passing through $1$, the bisection of $(0,2)$. As $r$ is constructible, so is $1+r$ (Exercise 10.1.3(a)). The intersection of the bisection of $(0,1+r)$ with the $x$-axis gives the number $(1+r)/2$, which is so constructible. The intersection of the circle with radius $(1+r)/2$ centered in $(1+r)/2$ with $D$ give $\beta$ with positive $y$-coordinate, and so $\beta$ is constructible.

The end of the proof of Theorem 10.1.4 shows that $\sqrt{r}$ is constructible.
\ee
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.4}

{\it This exercise covers the details omitted in the proof of Theorem 10.1.6.
\be
\item[(a)] Suppose that a line $l_1$ goes through distinct points $\alpha_1 = u_1+iv_1$ and $\beta_1 = u_2+iv_2$, where $u_1,v_1,u_2,v_2$ lie in a subfield $F \subset \R$. Prove that $l_1$ is defined by an equation of the form $a_1x +b_1y = c_1$ where $a_1,b_1,c_1 \in F$.
\item[(b)] Suppose that $\alpha_2 \ne \beta_2$ and $\gamma_2$ are complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts lie in a subfield $F\subset \R$. Prove that the circle $C$ with center $\gamma_2$ and radius $|\alpha_2-\beta_2|$ has an equation of the form (10.3) with $a_2,b_2,c_2 \in F$.
\item[(c)] In the proof of Theorem 10.1.6, we considered the equations (10.2) and (10.3) when $a_1\ne 0$. Explain what happens when $a_1 = 0$ in (10.2).
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)]
 Let $M = (x,y),A = (u_1,v_1),B = (u_2,,v_2)$ the points of $\R^2$ with affixes $z,\alpha_1,\beta_1$, where $\alpha_1\ne \beta_1$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
M \in (AB) &\iff \det(\overrightarrow{AM}, \overrightarrow{AB}) = 0\\
&\iff
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
  x-u_1& u_2-u_1    \\
  y-v_1& v_2-v_1      
\end{array}
\right|
=0\\
&\iff (v_2-v_1)x - (u_2-u_1)y -u_1(v_2-v_1) +v_1 (u_2-u_1) = 0\\
&\iff a_1x+b_1y = c_1
\end{align*}
where $a_1 = v_2-v_1, b_1 = -(u_2-u_1), c_1 = u_1(v_2-v_1) - v_1(u_2-u_1) \in F$.
\item[(b)] Let $z = x+iy, \gamma_2 = u+iv, \alpha_2 - \beta_2 = a +ib$, where $u,v,a,b \in F$. Then
\begin{align*}
z \in C &\iff |z-\gamma_2|^2 = |\alpha_2-\beta_2|^2\\
&\iff(x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2 = a^2+b^2\\
&\iff x^2+y^2+a_2x+b_2y+c_2 = 0,
\end{align*}
where $a_2 = -2u,b_2 = -2v ,c_2 = -(a^2+b^2) \in F$.
\item[(c)] If $a_1 = 0$, then for all $z =x+iy \in l$, $y=c_1/b_1 x = u$, where $u = c_1/b_1 \in F=F_n$. Substituting $y = u$ into (10.3) gives the quadratic equation
$$x^2+a_2x+u^2+b_2u+c_2.$$
Therefore $x$ lies in a quadratic extension $F_{n+1}$ of $F_n$ (and $y \in F_n \subset F_{n+1}$).
\ee
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.5}

{\it In this exercise you will give two proof that $\zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is constructible.
\be
\item[(a)] Give a direct geometric construction of $\zeta_3$ with each step justified by citing $C1,C2,P1,P2$ or $P3$.
\item[(b)] Use Theorem 10.1.6 to show that $\zeta_3$ is constructible.
\ee
}

\begin{proof} 
\be
\item[(a)]
As $\mathrm{Re}(\zeta_3) = -1/2$, $\zeta_3$ is on the bissection of $(-1,0)$.

We gives the details of the construction:
$C(0,1)$ and $C(-1,0)$ are constructible by $C2$, so the two intersection points are constructibles by $P3$, and these two points are $\zeta_3,\overline{\zeta}_3$, so $\zeta_3$ is constructible.
\item[(b)] As the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_3$ over $\Q$ is $x^2+x+1$, the extension $\Q\subset \Q(\zeta_3)$ is quadratic, so $\zeta_3$ is constructible by Theorem 10.1.6.
\ee
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.6}

{\it Show that it is impossible to trisect a 60¡ angle by straightedge and compass.
}

\begin{proof} If  a 20¡ angle was constructible by straightedge and compass, then $\zeta_{18}$ would be constructible. The minimal polynomial of $\zeta_{18}$ is $\Phi_{18}(x)$.

By Exercise 9.1.12, $\Phi_{18}(x) = \Phi_9(-x)$, and $\Phi_9(x) = \Phi_3(x^3) = x^6 +x^3+1$, so
$$\Phi_{18}(x) = x^6-x^3+1.$$
Therefore $[\Q(\zeta_{18}) : \Q] = 6$. If $\zeta_{18}$ was constructible, by Theorem 10.1.6, there exist subfields 
$$\Q = F_0 \subset F_1\subset \cdots \subset F_{n-1}\subset F_n \subset \C,$$
with $[F_i:F_{i-1}] = 2$ for $1\leq i \leq n$, and $\zeta_{18} \in F_n$. But then by the tower theorem, $6 = [\Q(\zeta_{18}) : \Q] $ divides $[F_n : \Q] = 2^n$, and $3 \mid 2^{n-1}$: this is a contradiction. So $\zeta_{18}$ is not constructible, hence it is impossible to trisect a 60¡ angle by straightedge and compass.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.10}

{\it Suppose we have extensions $\Q\subset F \subset \C$ where $[F:\Q]$ is finite. Prove that there is a field $M$ such that $F \subset M \subset \C$ and $M$ is a Galois closure of $F$ over $\Q$.
}

\begin{proof}
As $[F:\Q]$ is a finite extension, and as $\Q$ has characteristic 0, by the Theorem of the Primitive Element (Corollary 5.4.2 (b)), $F = \Q(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in F$. Let $f$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\Q$.

As $\C$ is an algebraically closed field, $f$ splits completely over $\C$. Let $\alpha_1=\alpha,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n$ the roots of $f$ in $\C$, and $M = \Q(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$ the splitting field of $f$ in $\C$. Then
\be
\item[(a)] $\Q \subset M$ is a Galois extension, since the splitting field of $f$ over $\Q$ is a normal extension of $\Q$, and separable since the characteristic of $\Q$ is 0.
\item[(b)] Let $M \subset M'$ by any other extension such that $M'$ is a Galois extension over $\Q$. As $\alpha \in M \subset M'$ is a root of $f$ and as $M'$ is normal, $f$ splits completely over $M'$, with roots $\beta_1 = \alpha_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n, \in M'$. Let $M'' = \Q(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n)$, so $M''$ is a splitting field of $f$ over $\Q$. By the uniqueness of splitting fields (Corollary 5.1.7), there is an isomorphism $\varphi:M\to M''$ that is the identity on $L$. Since $M'' \subset M'$, $\varphi$ defines a field homomorphism $\varphi:M \to M'$.
\ee
So the parts (a),(b) of the definition of an Galois closure are satisfied.

Conclusion: there is a field $M$ such that $F \subset M \subset \C$ and $M$ is a Galois closure of $F$ over $\Q$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.1.8}

{\it In the Mathematical notes we defined the field ${\cal P} \subset \R$ and what it means for a subfield $F \subset \R$ to be Pythagorean.
\be

\item[(a)] Let $\alpha$ be a real number. Prove that $\alpha \in {\cal P}$ if and only if there is a sequence of fields $\Q = F_0\subset \ldots \subset F_n \subset \R$ such that $\alpha \in F_n$, and for $i=1,\ldots,n$ there are $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1}$ such that $F_i = F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right)$.
\item[(b)] Prove that ${\cal P}$ is the smallest Pythagorean subfield of $\R$.
\ee
}

Write $\mathbb{P}$ the set of points of $\C$ (identified with the Euclidean plane) constructible by a sequence of straightedge-and-dividers constructions, and $\mathbb{D}$ the set of lines passing through two distinct such points (so constructible by straightedge-and-dividers) .

\bigskip

{\bf Lemma 1. } {\it If $A,B,C\in \mathbb{P}$, with $A\ne B$, then the parallel $l$ to $(AB)$ passing through $C$ is in $\mathbb{D}$.}
\begin{proof} Let $C'$ the symmetric point of $C$ relative to $A$, and $C''$ the symmetric point of $C'$ relative to $B$, so $\overrightarrow{AC'} = -\overrightarrow{AC}, \overrightarrow{BC''} = - \overline{BC'}$. Since $AC = AC'$ and $BC' = BC''$, $C',C''$ lie in  $\mathbb{P}$, and $\overrightarrow{CC''} = 2 \overrightarrow{AB}$, so $C \ne C''$ and $(CC'')$ is parallel to $(AB)$, with $(CC'') \in \mathbb{D}$. So $l = (CC'') \in \mathbb{D}$.
\end{proof} 

{\bf Lemma 2.}  ${\cal P}$ {\it is a subfield of $\R$.}
\begin{proof}
Using Lemma 1, we can mimic the proof of Theorem 8.1.4.
\end{proof}

{\bf Lemma 3.} {\it Let $\alpha = a+ib \in \C$, where $a,b \in \R$. Then $\alpha \in \mathbb{ P}$ if and only if $a,b \in {\cal P}$.}

%{\it  Let $l = (AB),\  A,B \in \mathbb{P}$, a straightedge-and-dividers constructible line, and $C \in \mathbb{P}$ a straightedge-and-dividers constructible point. Then line $l'$ passing trough $C$ and orthogonal to $l$ is a straightedge-and-dividers constructible line: $l' \in \mathbb{D}$.}

\begin{proof}

\be

\item[$\bullet$] Suppose that $\alpha =a +i b \in \mathbb{P}$. By Lemma 1, we can construct by straightedge-and-dividers constructions the lines passing through $\alpha$ and parallel to the axis, so $a, ib$ are constructible, and using the divider, so are  the real numbers $a,b$, therefore $a,b \in {\cal P}$.
\item[$\bullet$] Suppose that $a,b \in {\cal P}$. Then $a, ib \in \mathbb{P}$, and the intersection $\alpha = a+ib$ of the lines passing through these two points and parallel to the $y$-axis and $x$-axis respectively lies in $\mathbb{P}$.
\ee

\end{proof}


\begin{proof} (Ex. 10.1.8)
\be
\item[(a)] Let $\alpha$ be a real number.
\be
\item[$\bullet$]  Suppose that there is a sequence of fields $\Q = F_0\subset \ldots \subset F_n \subset \R$ such that $\alpha \in F_n$, and for $i=1,\ldots,n$ there are $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1}$ such that $F_i = F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right)$.

We prove by induction that $F_k \subset {\cal P}$. Since ${\cal P}$ is a subfield of $\R$, $F_0 = \Q \subset \R$. Suppose that $F_{i-1} \subset {\cal P}$. As $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1} \subset {\cal P}$, $\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2} \in {\cal P}$ (see the Mathematical Notes), so $F_i =F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right) \subset {\cal P}$, and the induction is done. 

Therefore  $F_n \subset {\cal P}$, and $\alpha \in F_n$, so $\alpha \in {\cal P}$. 

\item[$\bullet$]  Conversely, suppose that $\alpha = a+ib \in {\mathbb P}$. We use induction on the number $N$ of steps in the construction of $\alpha$ to prove that there is a sequence of subfield of $\R$, $\Q = F_0\subset \ldots \subset F_n \subset \R$ such that $a,b \in F_n$, where $F_i = F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right),\ i=1,\ldots,n$.

 When $N = 0$, we must have $\alpha = 0,1$ or $i$, in which case we let $F_n = F_0 = \Q$.

Now suppose that $\alpha$ is constructed in $N>1$ steps, where the last step use the intersection of two lines $l_1,l_2$. As in the proof of theTheorem 10.1.6, the coordinates of $\alpha$ lie in the same field $F_n$.

If the last step uses the divider, then their exists four points $\beta,\gamma, \delta, \varepsilon \in \mathbb{P}$ such that $\delta,\varepsilon, \alpha$ are collinear and $|\alpha - \delta| = |\beta - \gamma|$. Moreover, by the induction hypothesis,  the coordinates $\beta_x, \beta_y,\gamma_x,\ldots$ of $\beta,\gamma,\delta,\varepsilon$ are in $F_n$.

Then $\alpha - \delta = \lambda(\varepsilon - \delta), \lambda \in \R$, with
$$\lambda = \pm \frac{|\alpha - \delta|}{|\varepsilon - \delta|}=\pm \frac{|\beta - \gamma|}{|\varepsilon - \delta|}.$$
Let 
\begin{align*}
F_{n+1} &= F_n(|\beta - \gamma|) = F_n(\sqrt{s^2+t^2}), \mathrm{where}\  s = \beta_x - \gamma_x , t = \beta_y - \gamma_y \in F_n,\\
F_{n+2} &=F_{n+1}(|\varepsilon - \delta|) = F_{n+1}(\sqrt{u^2+v^2}),  \mathrm{where}\  u = \varepsilon_x - \delta_x, v = \varepsilon_y - \delta_y \in F_n.
\end{align*}
Then $\lambda \in F_{n+2}$. As $\alpha = a+ i b =  \delta + \lambda (\varepsilon - \delta)$, $a, b \in F_{n+2}$, and the induction is done.

In particular, if $\alpha = a+ib \in {\cal P} = \mathbb{P} \cap \R$, then $b=0, \alpha = b \in F_n$, where 
$\Q = F_0\subset \ldots \subset F_n \subset \R$ and there are $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1}$ such that $F_i = F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right),\ i = 1,\ldots,n$.
\ee
\item[(b)] By the Mathematical notes, if $a,b \in {\cal P}$, then $\sqrt{a^2+b^2} \in {\cal P}$, so $\cal P$ is a Pythagorean subfield of $\R$.

Let $K$ any Pythagorean subfield of $\R$, and take any $ \alpha \in {\cal P}$.  By part (a), there exists a sequence of subfields of $\R$,
$$\Q = F_0\subset \ldots \subset F_n \subset \R,$$
such that $\alpha \in F_n$, and for $i=1,\ldots,n$ there are $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1}$ such that $F_i = F_{i-1}\left(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2}\right)$.
As any subfield of $\R$, $K$ contains $\Q$, so $F_0 = \Q \in K$.

By induction, suppose that $F_{i-1} \subset K$ for some integer $i, 1 \leq i \leq n$. Then $F_i = F_{i-1}(\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2})$, where $a_i,b_i \in F_{i-1} \subset K$. As $K$ is Pythagorean, $\sqrt{a_i^2+b_i^2} \in K$, so $F_i \subset K$, and the induction is done.

So $F_n \subset K$, and $\alpha \in F_n$, so $\alpha \in K$. Hence ${\cal P} \subset K$, so $\cal P$ is the smallest Pythagorean subfield of $\R$.
\ee

{\it Show that the lune illustrated in the Historical Notes has the same area as the triangle $AOB$ in the illustration.
}

\begin{proof}
Let $l = OA=OB$ be the side of the triangle $OAB$, and $A = l^2/2$ the area of this triangle. 

The area of the semicircle with diameter $AB$ is $$A_1 = \frac{\pi}{4} l^2.$$
The area of the quarter circle with radius $0A$ is $\frac{\pi}{4} l^2,$
so the area between the arc $AB$ and the chord $AB$ is $$A_2 = \frac{\pi}{4} l^2 - A.$$
Therefore the area of the lune, the shaded region of the figure in historical notes, is
$$A_1 - A_2 = \frac{\pi}{4} l^2 -  \left(\frac{\pi}{4} l^2 - A\right) = A,$$
so is this area is the area $A = l^2/2$ of the triangle.

{\it The quadratrix is the curve $y = x \cot(\pi x/2)$ for $0<x\leq 1$. In this problem, you will use this curve to square the circle and trisect the angle.

\item[(f)] Using the quadratrix, what else can you do to angles besides trisecting them?
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] For all $x \in ]0,\pi]$,
$$x \cot\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{\pi}\,  \frac{{\frac{\pi x}{2}}}{{\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}}\,  \cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right).$$
As $\lim_{u\to 0} \frac{\sin u}{u} = 1$ and $\lim_{u\to 0} \cos(u)=1$, then
$$\lim_{x \to 0} x \cot\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{\pi}.$$

\item[(b)]
We say that a point $z =x +i y \in \C$, where $x,y \in \R$, is Hippias-constructible if there is a finite sequence of straightedge-and-compass constructions using $C1,C2,P1,P2$ and $P3$ that ends with $\alpha$ and begins with the set  of points $0,1$, together with the points $\beta = x+iy$, were $(x,y)$ lies in the graph of the quadratrix, $(0,2/\pi)$ included. Let $\mathbb{H} $ be the set of Hippias-constructible points. Then by Section 10.1, $\mathbb{H}$ is a subfield of $\C$, and ${\cal C}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{H}$.

As $(0,2/\pi)$ is on the quadratrix, $(2/\pi) i \in \mathbb{H}$. Since $i$ is constructible and since $\mathbb{H}$ is a field, $2/\pi \in \mathbb{H}$, so $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ are in $\mathbb{H}$. 
Then the proof of Theorem 10.1.4 shows that $\sqrt{\pi}\in \mathbb{H}$. If $r \in \R_+^*$ is a constructible number and the radius of a circle $C$, then $\sqrt{\pi} r \in \mathbb{H}$, so we can square every constructible circle with the quadratrix.

\item[(c)] As $M = (a,b)$ is on the quadratrix, $b = a \cot (\pi a/2)$. By definition, $\theta$ is a measure of the angle $\widehat{(\overrightarrow{OM}, \vec{e}_2)}$ (where $\vec{e}_2 = (0,1)$), then 
$$\frac{b}{a} = \cot \theta = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} a\right).$$
If $\theta = 0$, then $a = 0$. Since the restriction $\cot :\,  ]0, \pi/2] \to [0,+\infty[$ is strictly decreasing, hence is injective, and $\theta \in ]0, \pi/2], \frac{\pi}{2} a \in ]0, \pi/2]$, then 
$$\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} a,\qquad 0 \leq 1 \leq a.$$

\item[(d)]
Let $l$ a line containing the origin $O$, and $(a,b)$ the intersection of $l$ with the quadratrix. As in part (c),
$$\frac{b}{a} = \cot \theta = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} a\right).$$
Let $(c,d)$ be the point on the quadratrix corresponding with the angle $\theta/3$. Then
$$\frac{d}{c} = \cot \left( \frac{\theta}{3} \right) = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} c\right),$$
therefore, as in part (c), $\frac{\theta}{3} = \frac{\pi}{2} c$, so
$$c = \frac{a}{3}.$$
Starting from the line $l$, the quadratrix and the points $0,1$, We can construct with straightedge-and-compass $M=(a,b)$, and $c =a/3$ by the construction of Section 10.1, Figure 1, thus we can construct $M' = (c,d)$ at the intersection of the quadratrix and the vertical line passing through $(c,0)$, and this gives the constructive line $l' = OM'$ corresponding to the angle $\theta/3$. So we can trisect every angle $\widehat{(\overrightarrow{OM}, \vec{e}_2)}$, with measure $\theta,\ 0 < \theta <  \pi /2 $. 

\item[(e)]
Using construction given in Exercise 2 (a), we can transport with straightedge-and-compass constructions any given angle determined by  $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ (with measure $\theta,\ 0 < \theta <  \pi /2 $) on a congruent angle $\widehat{(\overrightarrow{OM}, \vec{e}_2)}$. The inverse transport gives the trisection of the given angle.
If $\pi/2 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ (obtuse angle), then we can trisect the constructive angle with measure $\theta - \pi/2$, the add the constructive angle with measure $\pi/6$. So we can trisect arbitrary angle with the quadratrix.

\item[(f)] In the reasoning of parts(d) and (e), we can replace $\theta/3$ by $\theta/n$, where $n$ is any positive integer. So we can divide any angle in $n$ parts with the quadratrix. Thanks to the quadratrix!

{\it Explain how the points of intersection of the parabolas $y=x^2$ and $x=y^2$ enable one to duplicate the cube. Your explanation should include a picture.
}

\begin{proof}
Let $(a,b)$ the intersection point (other than (0,0)) at the intersection of the two parabolas $y =x^2$ and $x = 2y^2$. Then $ a^2 = b, a = 2 b^2$. Multiplying these two equalities, we obtain
$$a^3 = 2 b^3.$$
The volume of the cube with side $a$ is twice the volume of the cube of side $b$.

\item[(a)] Explain how the spiral and $\theta = \pi/2$ enable one to square the circle.
\item[(b)] Given an angle $\theta_0$, explain how the spiral enables one to trisect $\theta_0$.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] If $M =(x,y)$ is a point of the spiral of Archimedes, then
$$r =\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = \theta.$$
If $\theta = \pi /2$, then $x = 0, y>0$, so $y = \pi/2$.
So $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ is constructible, if we add the spiral of Archimede to the starting of the construction, and also $\sqrt{pi}$ by Section 10.1. So the spiral of Archimedes enable one to square the circle.

\item[(b)] If $0 < \theta_0 < \pi$, let $M=(a,b)$ the corresponding point on the spiral, so $$r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \theta_0.$$ We can obtain by the geometric construction of Section 10.1 the real number $r' = r/3$. Let $C$ the circle with center 0 and radius $r' = r/3$. The intersection of $C$ with the spiral gives is the point $M' = (\cos(\theta/3),\sin(\theta/3))$, so the measure of the angle $\widehat{\vec{e}_1,\overrightarrow{OM'}}$ is $\theta_0 /3$. So the spiral enables one to trisect $\theta_0$.

{\it Suppose that $2^k+1$ is an odd prime. Prove that $k$ is a power of 2.
}

\begin{proof}Let $N = 2^k + 1, \ k\geq 1$ an odd prime. Suppose that there exists an odd divisor $q$ of $k$, so $k = ql$. Since $q$ is odd,
$$2^k+1 =2^{ql}+1 = (2^q + 1)(2^{q(l-1)} - 2^{q(l-2)}+ \cdots -2^q + 1) = (2^q+1)\sum_{j=0}^{l-1} (-1)^j 2^{qj},$$
so $2^q + 1$ divides $2^k+1$, and $1\leq q \leq k$, hence $ 1< 3 \leq 2^q + 1 \leq 2^k < 2^k+1$, so $2^q + 1$ is a nontrivial divisor of $N = 2^k+1$. Therefore $N$ is composite: this is a contradiction.

 Thus $k$ has no odd divisor, so $k = 2^n$ for some integer $n$, and $N = 2^{2^n}+ 1$ is a Fermat prime.

\item[(c)] Show that $\Phi_{p^2}(x+1)$ is irreducible over $\Q$ by the Schšnemann-Eisenstein criterion. As in the proof of Proposition 4.2.5, this will imply that the same is true for $\Phi_{p^2}(x)$.

}


{\bf Lemma.}
If $0<k<p^2$, then $p \mid \binom{p^2}{k}$.
\begin{proof}
Write $\nu_p(n)$ (or $\mathrm{ord}_p(n)$) the exponent of $p$ in the prime decomposition of the positive integer $n$. Then, for all positive integer $N$,
$$\nu_p(N!) =  \sum_ {i = 1}^{\infty} \left \lfloor \frac{N}{p^i} \right \rfloor =\left  \lfloor \frac{N}{p} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{N}{p^2}\right \rfloor + \cdots.$$
where the sum ends when $p^i>N$ (see a proof of this formula in Ireland-Rosen Exercise 2.6 on 
github.com/RichardGanaye/Ireland-Rosen).

Note that the $\left \lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right \rfloor = 0$ if $p^k >n$, so the sum is finite.

Suppose that $0<k<n$. Then
\begin{align*}
\nu_p\left(\frac{p^2}{k}\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^2  \left ( \left \lfloor \frac{p^2}{p^i} \right \rfloor  - \left \lfloor \frac{p^2-k}{p^i} \right \rfloor - \left \lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right \rfloor \right)\\
&= p -  \left \lfloor \frac{p^2-k}{p} \right \rfloor - \left \lfloor \frac{k}{p} \right \rfloor + 1 - \left \lfloor \frac{p^2-k}{p^2} \right \rfloor -  \left \lfloor \frac{k}{p^2} \right \rfloor\\
&= p+1 - \left \lfloor p -\frac{k}{p} \right \rfloor - \left \lfloor \frac{k}{p} \right \rfloor.
\end{align*}
Moreover, for all real $a,b$, $\lfloor a \rfloor + \lfloor b \rfloor \leq a+b$, and $\lfloor a \rfloor + \lfloor b \rfloor \in \Z$, hence 
$$\lfloor a \rfloor + \lfloor b \rfloor \leq \lfloor a + b \rfloor,$$
therefore
$$\left \lfloor p -  \frac{k}{p} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{k}{p} \right \rfloor \leq p,$$
so
$$ \nu_p\left(\frac{p^2}{k}\right) \geq 1,$$
thus $p \mid \binom{p^2}{k}$.

\end{proof}

\begin{proof} (Ex 10.2.2)
\be
\item[(a)] As in Example 9.1.6, using Proposition 9.1.5, we obtain
$$x^p -1 = \Phi_1(x) \Phi_p(x) \quad \mathrm{and} \quad x^{p^2} - 1 = \Phi_1(x) \Phi_p(x) \Phi_{p^2}(x).$$
Thus
$$x^{p^2} - 1 = (x^p-1) \Phi_{p^2}(x).$$
The substitution $x \to x+1$ gives
$$(x+1)^{p^2} - 1 = ((x+1)^p - 1)\Phi_{p^2}(x+1).$$

\item[(b)]
We know that $p \mid \binom{p}{k}, \ 1 \leq k \leq p-1$, and by Lemma, $p \mid \binom{p^2}{k},\ 1 \leq k \leq p^2 - 1$, so
$$(x+1)^p - 1 \equiv x^p \pmod p \quad \mathrm{and} \quad (x+1)^{p^2} - 1 \equiv x^{p^2} \pmod p.$$
The reduction modulo $p$ of the equality proved in part (a) gives
$$x^{p^2} = x^p\, \overline{\Phi}_{p^2}(x+1).$$

\item[(c)] As $ \overline{\Phi}_{p^2}(x+1) = x^{p^2-p}$, all the the coefficients of $\Phi_{p^2}(x+1)$ are divisible by $p$, except the leading coefficient. Moreover $\Phi_{p^2}(1) = p$, so the constant coefficient of $\Phi_{p^2}(x+1)$ is not divisible by $p^2$, so the Schšnemann-Eisenstein criterion shows that $\Phi_{p^2}(x+1)$ is irreducible over $\Q$, and this is equivalent to the irreducibility of $\Phi_p(x)$ over $\Q$.

{\it Using only Proposition 4.2.5, Theorem 10.1.12, and Exercise 1, show that $\zeta_p$ is constructible if and only if $p$ is a Fermat prime.
}

\begin{proof} 
Here we suppose that $p$ is an odd prime.

The splitting field of $\Phi_p$ over $\Q$ is $L = \ \Q(\zeta_p,\zeta_p^2,\ldots,\zeta_p^{p-1}) =\Q(\zeta_p)$. As $\Phi_p(\zeta_p) = 0$, and as $\Phi_p(x)$ is irreducible over $\Q$ (Proposition 4.2.5), $\Phi_p$ is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_p$ over $\Q$, hence
$$[L : \Q] = [\Q(\zeta_p) : \Q] = \deg(\Phi_p) = p-1.$$

\be
\item[$\bullet$] Suppose that $p$ is a Fermat prime, so $p=2^n +1$, where $n=2^k, k\in \N$. Then $[L:\Q] = 2^n$, where $L$ is the splitting field of $\Phi_p$ over $\Q$. By the authorized Theorem 10.1.12, $\zeta_p$ is constructible.

\item[$\bullet$]  Conversely, if we suppose that $\zeta_p$ is constructible, by the same Theorem 10.1.12, $[L:\Q] = 2^n$ for some integer $n\geq 0$, so $p=2^n+1$. As $p$ is prime, by Exercise 1, $p=2^k,\ k\in \N$, so $ = 2^{2^k}+1$ is a Fermat prime.

}

\begin{proof} 
\be
\item[$\bullet$]  Suppose that $m \mid n,\ m>0$. Since $n/m$ is an integer,
$$(\zeta_n)^{\frac{n}{m}} = \left ( e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}} \right )^{\frac{n}{m}} = e^{\frac{n}{m} \frac{2\pi i}{n}} = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{m}} = \zeta_m.$$
\item[$\bullet$] If $\zeta_n$ is constructible, and $m\mid n, m>0$, by part (a)
$$\zeta_m = (\zeta_n)^{\frac{n}{m}} $$

As the set of constructible points is a subfield of $\C$, $\zeta_m$ is constructible.

\item[(c)] Conclude that $\zeta_n$ is constructible, since $\zeta_{2^s},\zeta_{p_1},\ldots, \zeta_{p_r}$ are.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] The minimal polynomial of $\zeta_{2^s}$ over $Q$ is $\Phi_{2^s}(x)$, and $$\deg(\Phi_{2^s}(x)) = \phi(2^s) = 2^{s-1}(2-1) = 2^{s-1}.$$ Therefore $[\Q(\zeta_s) : \Q] = \deg(\Phi_{2^s}(x)) = 2^{s-1}$ is a power of 2. Since $\Q(\zeta_{2^s})$ is the splitting field of $\Phi(\zeta_{2^s})$ over $\Q$, by Theorem 10.1.12, $\zeta_{2^s}$ is constructible.

Note 1. Since $x^{2^s} - 1 = \Phi_1(x)\Phi_2(x)\cdots \Phi_{2^{s-1}}(x) \Phi_{2^s}(x) = (x^{2^{s-1}}-1) \Phi_{2^s}(x)$, we see that $\Phi_{2^s}(x) = x^{2^{s-1}} +1$. 

Note 2. Without Theorem 10.1.12, we can prove that $\zeta_{2^s}$ is constructible more geometrically by constructing a $2^s$-gon. $\zeta_{2} = -1$ is constructible. Reasoning by induction, suppose that $\zeta_{2^{s-1}}$ is constructible. Since $(\zeta_{2^s})^2 = \zeta_{2^{s-1}}$, $\zeta_{2^s}$ is the intersection point of the circle $C(0,1)$ with the constructible bisector of the angle determined by $0,1,\zeta_{2^{s-1}}$, so is constructible.

\item[(b)] 
Since $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, there exists $u,v \in \Z$ such that $ua+vb = 1$.

Then $\frac{v}{a}+ \frac{u}{b} = \frac{1}{ab}$, thus 
$$\zeta_a^v \zeta_b^u = e^{2\pi i \left(\frac{v}{a}+ \frac{u}{b} \right)} = e^{\frac{2\pi i }{ab}} = \zeta_{ab}.$$
So $\zeta_{ab} = \zeta_a^v \zeta_b^u$, product of constructible numbers, is constructible.

\item[(c)] 
We show first that two distinct Fermat primes $F_n = 2^{2^n} +1, F_m = 2^{2^m}+1, \ n < m$ are relatively prime. By reductio ad absurdum, suppose that a prime $q$ divides $F_n$ and $F_m$. Then $2^{2^n} \equiv -1 \pmod q$, and
$$-1 \equiv 2^{2^m} \equiv (2^{2^n})^{2^{m-n}} \equiv (-1)^{2^{m-n}} \equiv 1 \pmod q.$$
Therefore $q\mid 2$, so $q=2$, but this is impossible since $F_n$ is odd. 

So $n\ne m \Rightarrow \gcd(F_n,F_m) = 1$.

Since since $\zeta_{2^s},\zeta_{p_1},\ldots, \zeta_{p_r}$ are constructible, and $2^s,p_1,p_r$ are relatively prime, by part (b), $\zeta_{2^s p_1},\, \zeta_{2^s p_1 p_2}, \ldots, \zeta_{ 2^s p_1\cdots p_r} = \zeta_n$ are constructible.

\begin{proof}

 $$[L:\Q] = \deg(\Phi_{p^2}) = p(p-1).$$
 By Theorem 10.1.12, $\zeta_{p ^2}$ being constructible, $[L:\Q] = p(p-1)$ is a power or 2, so $p$ is a power of 2 , where $p$ is an odd prime. This is a contradiction.

$3,5,17$ are well-known primes.

Since $3^{(F_3-1)/2} = 3^{128} \equiv -1 \pmod {257}$, and $3^{(F_4-1)/2} = 3^{32768} \equiv -1 \pmod {65537}$, the order of $[3]$ is $2^{2^n} = F_{n} - 1$ in $(\Z/F_n\Z)^*$ for $n=3,4$, so the Lucas test proves that $F_3, F_4$ are prime numbers.

\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)]The dashed line $l$ is the fold of the sheet that applies $P_1$ on $Q_1$ and $P_2$ on $Q_2$. Let $s$ the reflection (orthogonal symmetry) with regard to the line $l$. 

Then $s(P_2) = Q_2$, and $s(Q_1) = P_1$, so $s$ applies the line $\overline{P_2 Q_1}$ on the line $\overline{P_1Q_2}$. Let $Q$ be the intersection point of these two lines. 

Then $s(Q)$ is on the images of these two lines, so $$s(Q) \in s(\overline{P_1Q_2}) \cap s(\overline{P_2 Q_1}) = \overline{P_2 Q_1} \cap \overline{P_1Q_2} = \{Q\},$$ therefore $s(Q) = Q$.

 Since the set of points $M$ such that $s(M) = M$ is the line $l$, we conclude that $Q \in l$.
 
 \item[(b)] Let $D$ the point at the bottom right corner, and $\delta$ a measure of the angle $(\widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1D},\overrightarrow{P_1,Q_1}})$. 
 
 As $(\widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1D},\overrightarrow{P_1Q_1}}) + (\widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1Q_1},\overrightarrow{P_1Q_2}}) =( \widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1D},\overrightarrow{P_1Q_2}})$, then $\theta = \delta+ \alpha$.
 
 Since $PQ_1$ and $P_1D$ are parallel, $(\widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1D},\overrightarrow{P_1Q_1}}) = (\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P},\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1}})$ (alternate interior angles), so $\beta = \delta$. We can deduce of these two equalities that $$\theta = \alpha + \beta.$$
 
  \item [(c)] The reflection $r$ with regard to the line $l_1$ sends $P_1$ on $P_2$ and $Q_1$ on $Q_1$, therefore $Q_1P1 = Q_1P_2$, so the triangle $\bigtriangleup Q_1P_1P_2$ is isosceles, and
  $$(\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P},\overrightarrow{Q_1P_2}}) = - (\widehat{\overrightarrow{r(Q_1)r(P)},\overrightarrow{r(P_1)r(Q_1)}}) =- (\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P},\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1}}),$$
  so the absolute value of the measures of these angles are the same, so $$\beta = \gamma.$$
  
\item[(d)] The reflection $s$ of part (a) sends $Q$ on $Q$, and $P_1$ on $Q_1$, therefore $QP_1 = QQ_1$. The triangle $\bigtriangleup Q P_1 Q_1$ is isosceles, so the corresponding angles are equal:
$$ -(\widehat{\overrightarrow{P_1Q_1},\overrightarrow{P_1Q}}) =  (\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1},\overrightarrow{Q_1Q}}) =
 (\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P_1},\overrightarrow{Q_1P}}) + (\widehat{\overrightarrow{Q_1P},\overrightarrow{Q_1Q}}),$$
so $$\alpha = \beta + \gamma.$$

\item[(d)] From $\delta = \beta$ and from the three equalities obtained in parts (b),(c),(d):
\begin{align*}
\theta &= \alpha + \beta,\\
\beta &= \gamma,\\
\alpha &= \beta + \gamma,
\end{align*}
we conclude that $\alpha = 2 \beta$, $\theta = 3 \beta = 3 \delta$, so $\alpha = 2\theta /3$, and
$$\delta = \theta/3.$$
This means that the measure of the  angle formed by   the bottom of the square  and $\overline{P_1Q_1}$ is $\theta/3$.

\item[(a)] Explain how to bisect and double angles by origami.
\item[(b)] Explain how to trisect an arbitrary angle by origami.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\item[(a)] To bisect the same angle $\theta$, we apply the same line $l_2$ on the bottom line. The fold is on the bisector of the angle.
To double the angle, we fold the sheet along the line $l_2$. Then the bottom line goes on the line that makes a double angle with the bottom line.
\item[(b)] If the angle $\theta$ is between $0$ and $\pi/4$, the angle $\theta' = \pi/2 - \theta$ is constructible by origami with the symmetry with regard to the bisector of the bottom left corner, and $\theta'$ is between $\pi/4$ and $\pi/2$, so we can trisect it, and we obtain the angle $\pi/6 - \theta/3$. As $\pi/6$ is origami-constructible by trisection of the angle $\pi/2$ (here $Q=P_2=Q_2$) and as we can add or remove an origami-constructible angle, then so is the angle $\theta/3$.

If $\theta$ is between $\pi/2$ and $\pi$, Then $\theta'' = \pi - \theta$ is origami-constructible and between $0$ and $\pi/2$, so we can trisect it. We obtain the angle $\pi/3 - \theta/3$, where $\pi/3$ is the double of the origami-constructible angle $\pi/6$, so the angle $\theta/3$ is also origami-constructible.

\item[(d)] Part (c) proves one direction of Lemma 10.3.1. Prove the other direction to complete the proof of the lemma.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)]
Let $\cal P$ be the parabola with focus $P_1$ and directrix $l_1$.

With the chosen coordinates system, let $Q (x,y)$ a point in the plane, and $Q_1$ the orthogonal projection of $Q$ on the directrix.  Since $P_1(0,a)$ and $Q_1(x,-a)$,
\begin{align*}
Q \in {\cal P} &\iff QP_1^2 = QQ_1^2\\
&\iff x^2+(y-a)^2 = (y+a)^2\\
&\iff x^2+y^2-2ay +a^2 = y^2+2ay +a^2\\
&\iff x^2 = 4ay
\end{align*}
So the equation of ${\cal P}$ is $${\cal P} : x^2 = 4ay.$$

\item[(b)] Let $Q(x_0,y_0)$ be a point on the parabola, so $x_0^2 = 4ay_0$.

Write $F(x,y) = x^2-4ay$.  The equation of the tangent $T$ to $\cal P$ at the point $Q$ is given by
\begin{align*}
0 &=\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) (x-x_0) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) (y-y_0), \\
0&= 2x_0(x-x_0) - 4a(y-y_0),\\
&2x_0x -4ay = 2x_0^2 - 4ay_0 = 4ay_0.
\end{align*}
So the equation of $T$ is
$$T : x_0x -2ay = 2ay_0.$$


Let $R(x_R,y_R)$ the intersection point of $T$ with the $y$-axis. 

Then $x_R=0$, so $-2ay_R = 2ay_0,\ y_R = -y_0$,
$$R(0,-y_0).$$

\item[(c)] Write $MN = || \overrightarrow{MN} ||$ the length of the segment $\overline{MN}$.

$$P_1(0,a), \quad R(0,-y_0),\quad Q_1(x_0,-a),\quad Q(x_0,y_0), \quad (a>0,y_0>0), $$
 thus $\overrightarrow{P_1R} = (0, -a -y_0 ) =\overrightarrow{ QQ_1}$, hence $P_1R = QQ_1$. By definition of the parabola,  $QP_1=QQ_1$, so 
 
 $QP_1 = y_0 +a = \sqrt{x_0^2 +(y_0-a)^2} = RQ_1$, therefore
 $$QP_1 = QQ_1 = P_1R = RQ_1:$$
 $(Q,P_1,R,Q_1)$ is a rhombus, whose length of side is $c = a+y_0$. Hence the diagonals $(P_1Q_1)$ and $T = (QR)$ are perpendicular. We give a direct proof: as $\overrightarrow{P_1R} = \overrightarrow{QQ_1}$,
 \begin{align*}
 \overrightarrow{QR}\,. \,\overrightarrow{P_1Q_1} &=( \overrightarrow{QP_1}+\overrightarrow{P_1R})\,.\,(\overrightarrow{P_1Q}+\overrightarrow{QQ_1})\\
 &=\overrightarrow{QP_1}\,.\,\overrightarrow{P_1Q} +\overrightarrow{QP_1}\,.\,\overrightarrow{QQ_1}+ \overrightarrow{P_1R}\,.\,\overrightarrow{P_1Q}+\overrightarrow{P_1R}\,.\,\overrightarrow{QQ_1}\\
 &= -c^2 +\overrightarrow{QP_1}(\overrightarrow{QQ_1} - \overrightarrow{P_1R}) + c^2\\
 &=0
 \end{align*}
  As in any parallelogram, the intersection of the diagonals is the middle point of $(P_1,Q_1)$ and $(Q,R)$, so $Q_1$ is the reflection of $P_1$ about the tangent line to the parabola at $Q$.
  
  \item[(d)] 
  Conversely, let $Q_1(x_0,-a)$ be any point on the directrix $l_1$, and $l$ the bisection of $(P_1,Q_1)$. We must prove that $l$ is tangent to the parabola $\cal P$.
  Let $M(x,y)$ a point of the plane. With $P_1(0,a)$, and $Q_1(x_0,-a)$,
\begin{align*}
M\in l &\iff MP_1^2 = MQ_1^2\\
&\iff x^2+(y-a)^2 = (x-x_0)^2+(y+a)^2\\
&\iff x^2+y^2-2ay+a^2 = x^2-2x_0x+x_0^2+y^2+2ay+a^2\\
&\iff x_0x-2ay = \frac{x_0^2}{2}
\end{align*}
 If we write $y_0 = \frac{x_0^2}{4a}$, then the point $M_0(x_0,y_0)$ lies on the parabola $\cal P$. Since $x_0^2-2ay_0 = \frac{x_0^2}{2}$, $M_0$ lies also on $l$. By part (b), the equation of the tangent $T$ at point $M_0$ is $x_0x -2ay_0 = 2ay_0 = x_0^2/2$, hence $T = l$, so $l$ is tangent to the parabola $\cal P$.
 
 Conclusion: the reflexion of $P_1$ about $l$ lies on the directrix $l_1$ if and only if $l$ is tangent to the parabola with focus $P_1$ and directrix $l_1$.

{\it Show that the tangent line at a point $(x_1,y_1)$ on the first parabola in (10.9) has slope given by

\begin{proof}The equation of the tangent $T$ at the point $M_1(x_1,y_1)$ to the parabola whose equation is
$$f(x,y) = 2bx - \left(y-\frac{1}{2}a\right)^2 =0,$$

so the equation of $T$ is
$$T : bx - \left(y_1-\frac{1}{2}a\right)y -bx_1+\left(y_1-\frac{1}{2}a\right)y_1 = 0.$$

\ee
}

\begin{proof}
As the discriminant of  $f(x) = x^3+2x+1\ (p=2,q=1)$ is $\Delta_f = -4p^3-27q^2 = -59<0$, there is a unique real root.
First we compute this real root $\alpha$ with Cardano's method. There exists a pair of complex numbers $u,v$ such that
$$ u+v = \alpha, \qquad uv = -\frac{2}{3}$$
(the roots of $y^2 - \alpha y -\frac{2}{3}$).

Since $2+3uv=0$,
\begin{align*}
0 &= \alpha^3+2\alpha+1\\
&= u^3+v^3+1+ (2 + 3 uv)(u+v)\\
&= u^3+v^3+1
\end{align*}
So $u^3,v^3$ satisfy
\begin{align*}
-1 &=u^3 + v^3 \\
-\frac{8}{27} &=u^3v^3 
\end{align*}
Therefore $u^3,v^3$ are the roots of $y^2 +y - \frac{8}{27}$:
$$\{u^3,v^3\} = \left \{\frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} - \frac{1}{2},\quad - \frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} - \frac{1}{2}\right \}.$$
Thus
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} - \frac{1}{2}} - \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} + \frac{1}{2}},\\
\end{align*}
which is equal to
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} - \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{2}{3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{18} \sqrt{177} - \frac{1}{2}}} \approx -0.4534.
\end{align*}

\item[(a)] By Exercise 7, the focus and directrix of ${\cal P}_1 : (y-1)^2 = 2x$ are $$F_1\left (\frac{1}{2},1\right), \qquad D_1 : x = -\frac{1}{2},$$
and the focus and directrix of ${\cal P}_2 : y = \frac{x^2}{2}$ are $$F_2\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right), \qquad D_2 : y = -\frac{1}{2}.$$

As all the points have rational coordinates, and the lines rational coefficients, they are constructible by origami. More precisely, take two arbitrary points on the $x$-axis to represent $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. For instance the middle point of the sheet, obtained by folding the paper so that the left edge touches the right, represent the origin, and the  fold is then the $y$ axis. A second fold so that the right edge touches the $y$-axis gives an intersection point with the $x$-axis which we take as the point $(1,0)$.

We obtain similarly the point $(0,1)$ and dividing by 2 with horizontal and vertical folds, we obtain $F_1,D_1,F_2,D_2$.

\item[(b)] As seen in part (a), the discriminant of $x^3+2x+1$ is $\Delta_f =  -59<0$, the equation (10.12) $m^3+am+b = 0$, where $a = 2,b=1$, has a unique real solution $\alpha$. As the slope of a commune tangent to the parabolas ${\cal P}_1,{\cal P}_2$ is a  root of this equation, the slope of such a tangent is $m=\alpha$. Since the intersection point $M_1(x_1,y_1)$ of the tangent with the parabola ${\cal P}_1$ satisfies (10.10)
$$x_1 = \frac{b}{2m^2}, \qquad y_1 = \frac{b}{m} + \frac{a}{2}$$
this intersection point is determined by $m = \alpha$, and similarly the tangent point  $M_2(x_2,y_2)$ with ${\cal P}_2$ is uniquely determined by 
$$x_2 = m, \qquad y_2 = \frac{m^2}{2},$$ so there is at most one common tangent to the two parabolas, and at most one way to take the focus of each parabola to a point on the corresponding directrix.

Conversely, we must prove the existence of a common tangent.

Let $D$ the line of slope $\alpha$ passing by $M_2(x_2,y_2)$, with $(x_2,y_2) = (\alpha,\frac{\alpha^2}{2})$. The equation of $D$ is given by $y-\frac{\alpha^2}{2} = \alpha (x-\alpha)$, so
$$D : -\alpha x + y +\frac{\alpha^2}{2}.$$

$D$ contains $M_1(x_1,y_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1) = (\frac{1}{2\alpha^2},1+\frac{1}{\alpha})$, since
$$-\alpha\left (\frac{1}{2\alpha^2}\right) + 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha} + \frac{\alpha^2}{2} = \frac{1}{2\alpha}(\alpha^3+2\alpha+1) = 0.$$

By Example 10.3.2 and Exercise 4, the slope of the tangent $T_1$ to ${\cal P}_1$ at $M_1$ is $m = \frac{b}{y_1-\frac{1}{2}a} = \alpha$, and the slope of the tangent $T_2$ to ${\cal P}_2$ at $M_2$ is $m = x_2 = \alpha$, so $D = T_1 = T_2$, therefore $D$ is tangent to ${\cal P}_1$ and ${\cal P}_2$. This proves the existence of one common tangent $D$ to the two parabolas, with equation
$$D : -\alpha x + y +\frac{\alpha^2}{2}.$$

Conclusion : there is exactly one way to take the focus of each parabola to a point on the corresponding directrix.

\item[(c)] Let $F'_2$ be the reflexion of the focus $F_2$ of ${\cal P}_2$ about the common tangent $D$. By Exercise 3, the line $(M_2F_2)$ is parallel to the $y$-axis, so the abscissa of $F'_2$ is $$x_2 =m.$$
A vertical fold is obtained by the perpendicular line tho the horizontal fold passing by $F_2$. The intersection of this fold with the $x$-axis gives the point $(m,0)$, with $m\approx -0.45$

(Another method consists to construct the parallel to the tangent $D$ passing by the origin. The intersection of this parallel with the line $x=1$ gives the point $(1,m)$.)

{\it Supose that in the situation of C3, we have points $\alpha_1\ne \alpha_2$ not lying on lines $l_1\ne l_2$.

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $l$ reflects $\alpha_1$ to $\beta_1 \in l_1$ and $\alpha_2$ to $\beta_2 \in l_2$.

Let $d =d(l_1,l_2)$ the distance between $l_1$ and $l_2$. If $\gamma$ is the orthogonal projection of $\beta_1$ on $l_2$, then by definition, $d = |\beta_1 - \gamma|$. By Pythagoras Theorem,
$$|\beta_1 - \gamma|^2 + |\gamma - \beta_2|^2 = |\beta_1 - \beta_2|^2.$$
Therefore $d^2 = |\beta_1 - \gamma|^2 \leq |\beta_1 - \beta_2|^2$, so $$d \leq |\beta_1 - \beta_2|.$$
Moreover the the reflexion about $l$ preserves the distances between points, so
$$|\beta_1 - \beta_2| = |\alpha_1 - \alpha_2|.$$

To conclude, the distance $d$ between $l_1$ and $l_2$ is at most the distance between $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.

For instance, let $l_1$ be the line with equation $y=0$, $l_2$ with equation $y=-2$, $\alpha_1 = i, \alpha_2 = 1+i$. Then $d = d(l_1,l_2) = 2 > |\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 |$, so there is no line $l$ that reflects $\alpha_1$ on a point on $l_1$ and $\alpha_2$ on a point on $l_2$. In other words, there is no common tangent to the two parabolas with focus $\alpha_i$ and directrix $l_i$, $i=1,2$, with equations
\begin{align*}
{\cal P}_1 &: y = \frac{1}{2} (x^2+1)\\

So the second parabola $y = x^2/2$ has focus $\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ and directrix $y=-\frac{1}{2}$.

{\bf Theorem 10.3.6} Let $\alpha \in \C$  be algebraic over $\Q$ and let $\Q \subset L$ be the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\Q$. Then $\alpha$ is an origami number if and only if $[L:\Q] = 2^a3^b$ for some integer $a,b\geq 0$.
}

\begin{proof} 

We first prove that $\Q \subset \cal O$ is a normal extension. 
Let $\alpha \in {\cal O}$, and let $f(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\Q$. By Theorem 10.3.4, there are subfields
$$\Q=F_0\subset F_1\subset \cdots \subset F_{n-1} \subset F_n \subset \C$$
such that $\alpha \in F_n$ and $[F_i:F_{i-1}] = 2$ or $3$ for $1\leq i \leq n$.

By Exercise 10.1.7, there exists a Galois closure $\Q\subset M$ of $\Q\subset F$ such that $M\subset \C$, so $\Q \subset F_n \subset M \subset \C$ and $\Q \subset M$ is a Galois extension.
Note that $f$ splits completely in $M$, since $M$ is normal over $\Q$, $f$ is irreducible over $\Q$, and $\alpha \in F_n \subset M$ is a root of $f$.

Now let $\beta \in M$ be any root of $f$. By Proposition 5.1.8, there is $\sigma \in \Gal(M/\Q)$ such that $\sigma(\alpha) = \beta$. Applying $\sigma$ to the fields $\Q=F_0 \subset \cdots \subset F_n \subset M$ gives
$$\Q \subset \sigma(\Q)=\sigma(F_0) \subset \cdots \subset \sigma(F_n)$$
such that $[\sigma(F_i):\sigma(F_{i-1}] = [F_i:F_{i-1}] = 2$ or $3$ for all $i$.

By Theorem 10.3.4, $\beta = \sigma(\alpha) \in \sigma(F_n)$ is an origami number, so $\beta \in {\cal O}$, so we can conclude that $ \Q \subset \cal O$ is a normal extension.
\be
\item[$\bullet$] Suppose that $\alpha \in {\cal O}$  and let $\Q \subset L$ be the splitting field of the minimal polynomial $f$ of $\alpha$ over $\Q$. Since $\Q \subset \cal O$ is normal, $L \subset {\cal O}$. By the theorem of the Primitive Element, we have $L = \Q(\gamma)$ for some $\gamma \in L$. Since $\gamma \in {\cal O}$, there are subfields
$$\Q=F'_0\subset F'_1\subset \cdots \subset F'_{n-1} \subset F'_m \subset \C$$
such that $\gamma \in F_m$ and $[F'_i:F'_{i-1}] = 2$ or $3$ for $1\leq i \leq m$.

As $\Q \subset \Q(\gamma) \subset F'_m$, by the Tower Theorem, 

$[L : \Q] = [\Q(\gamma) : \Q]$ divides $[F'm:\Q] = 2^u3^v,\ u,v \in \N$, so 
\begin{center}
$[L:\Q] = 2^a3^b$ for some integer $a,b\geq 0$.
\end{center}

\item[$\bullet$] Conversely, suppose that $[L:\Q] = 2^a3^b$ for some integer $a,b\geq 0$.

Since $\Q \subset L$ is Galois, then $G =\Gal(L/\Q)$ satisfies $|G | = [L:\Q]$ is of the form
$$|G| = 2^a 3^b.$$
By Burnside's $p^nq^m$ Theorem (Theorem 8.1.8), $G$ is solvable., so we have subgroups
$$\{e\}=G_m \subset G_{m-1} \subset \cdots \subset G_1 \subset G_0 = G = \Gal(L/\Q)$$
such that $G_i$ is normal in $G_{i-1}$ of index 2 or 3, since $|G| = 2^a 3^b$. The Galois Correspondence Theorem gives
$$\Q=L_{G_0} \subset L_{G_1} \subset \cdots \subset L_{G_m} = L,$$
where $[L_{G_i}:L_{G_{i-1}}] = 2$ or 3 for all $i$.

By Theorem 10.3.4, $\alpha \in L$ is an origami number.

}

\begin{proof} Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)$, with $d = \deg(f) \leq 4$. 

Let $L$ be the splitting field of $\alpha$. 

Recall that the Galois group $\Gal(L/\Q)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$, so 
$$ |\Gal(L/\Q)| = [L:\Q]\ \mathrm{divides} \  4!.$$
So $[L:\Q]$ divides $4! = 2^3 \times 3$ , therefore $[L:\Q] = 2^a 3^b$ for some $a,b$ with  $0\leq a \leq 3,\  0 \leq b \leq 1$. By Theorem 10.3.6 and Exercise 8, $\alpha$ is an origami number.

\begin{proof}
The equation of the line $l$ with slope $m$ through $P=(\frac{1}{2},0)$ is
$$ l: y = m\left (x-\frac{1}{2}\right).$$

The intersection point $(x_1,y_1)$ of $l$ with $l_1: y=x$ is given by the system
\begin{align*}
y_1 &= x_1\\
y_1 &= m\left (x_1-\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}
which gives $x_1 = m\left (x_1-\frac{1}{2}\right)$,  $2x_1 = 2mx_1-m$, so
$$Q_1 = (x_1,y_1) = \left ( \frac{m}{2m-2}, \frac{m}{2m-2}\right).$$
The intersection point $(x_2,y_2)$ of $l$ with $l_2: y=-\frac{1}{2}x$ is given by the system
\begin{align*}
y_2 &= -\frac{1}{2}x_2\\
y_2 &= m\left (x_2-\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}
which gives $-\frac{1}{2}x_2 = m\left (x_2-\frac{1}{2}\right)$, so
$$Q_2 = (x_2,y_2) = \left ( \frac{m}{2m+1}, -\frac{m}{2(2m-2)}\right).$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
Q_1Q_2 = 1 &\iff 1 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 \\
&\iff 1 = \left(\frac{m}{2m+1} -  \frac{m}{2m-2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{m}{2(2m+1)} - \frac{m}{2m-2}\right)^2 \\
&\iff 1 = m^2 \left[\left(\frac{2}{4m+2} - \frac{1}{2m-2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{4m+2} + \frac{1}{2m-2}\right)^2 \right]\\
& \iff 1 = \frac{m^2}{(4m+2)^2(2m-2)^2} \left\{ [(2(2m-2)-(4m+2)]^2 + [2m-2+4m+2]^2\right \}\\
&\iff (4m+2)^2(2m-2)^2 = m^2(36+36m^2)\\
&\iff 16 (2m+1)^2(m-1)^2 = 36 m^2(1+m^2)\\
&\iff 4(2m+1)^2(m-1)^2 = 9 m^2(1+m^2)\\
&\iff 16 m^4-16m^3-12m^2+8m+ 4 = 9 m^4 + 9m^2\\
&\iff 7m^4-15m^3-21m^2+8m+4 = 0

{\it This exercise will give an example of a cubic equation that arises from verging.

Show that this gives the vertical line $x=1$ together with three nonvertical lines whose slopes $m$ satisfy the cubic equation
$$ 4m^3+m^2-4m+1 = 0.$$
Also show that the nonvertical lines cannot be constructed by straightedge and compass.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=9cm,height=8cm] {marquedRulers3.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
Here a solution is the vertical line $x = 1$, corresponding to $m = \infty$, since the intersection of this line with $l_1$ and $l_2$ are the points $Q_1=(1,0), Q_2 = (1,1)$ such that $Q_1Q_2 = 1$.

Any nonvertical line $l$ with slope $m$ through $P = (1,\frac{1}{2})$ has an equation
$$l : y - \frac{1}{2} = m (x-1).$$
The intersection point of $l$ with $l_1 : y = 0$ and the intersection of $l$ with $l_2 : y=x$ are the points
\begin{align*}
Q_1 &= (x_1,y_1) =  \left (\frac{2m-1}{2m},0 \right),\\
Q_2 &= (x_2,y_2) =  \left (\frac{2m-1}{2m-2}, \frac{2m-1}{2m-2} \right)
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
Q_1Q_2 = 1 &\iff1= (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\\
&\iff 1=\left(\frac{2m-1}{2m-2} - \frac{2m-1}{2m} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{2m-1}{2m-2} \right)^2\\
&\iff (2m-1)^2 \left[ \left(\frac{2}{2m(2m-2)} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{(2m-2)^2} \right]\\
&\iff 1 = \frac{(2m-1)^2}{(2m-2)^2} \left ( \frac{1}{m^2} + 1 \right)\\
&\iff 4m^2(m-1)^2 = (2m-1)^2(m^2 + 1)\\
&\iff 4m^4 - 8m^3 + 4m^2 = 4 m^4 - 4m^3+ 5m^2 - 4m+1\\
&\iff 4m^3+m^2 - 4m+1 = 0
\end{align*}
Let $f(x) = 4x^3+x^2-4x+1$, then 
$$\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x) = -\infty,\quad  f\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{79}{27} >0,\quad  f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{4}<0,\quad  \lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x)= +\infty.$$ Therefore $f(x)$ has three real roots
$$m_1 \approx 0.2991, m_2 \approx -1.2290, m_3 \approx 0.6799.$$
This gives 4 solutions with $m=\infty$.
(see figure.)

$f(x)$ has no rational root. Indeed , if $\alpha = \frac{p}{q}, p,q \in \Z, q>0, p\wedge q = 1$ is a root of $f$, then $4p^3+p^2q-4pq^2+q^3 = 0$, so $p^3 \mid 1, q^3 \mid 2$, therefore $p = \pm 1, q =1$, so $\alpha = \pm 1$, but neither 1 nor $-1$ is a root of $f$. Since$\deg(f) = 3$, $f$ is irreducible over $\Q$ and the minimal polynomial of $m_1,m_2$ or $m_3$ over $\Q$ is $f$.

Let $L = \Q(m_1) = \Q(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ the splitting field of $f$.
The discriminant of $f$ is $\Delta_f = 316 = 2^2 \times 79$, where $79$ is prime, so $\Delta_f$ is not a square in $\Q$, so $\Gal(L:\Q) \simeq S_3$, therefore $[L:\Q] = 6$ is not a power of 2, so $m_1,m_2,m_3$ are not constructible numbers. Therefore the nonvertical lines are not constructible by straightedge and compass.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.3.12}

{\it Prove that $\angle PRO = \theta/3$ in the construction (10.18). 
}

\begin{proof} 
 Let $\alpha = \angle PRO$. Since $QR = QO=1$ , $\triangle QRO$ is isosceles, so $\angle QOR = \alpha$. Therefore the extern angle $\angle OQP = 2\alpha$. Since $OQ = OP =1$, $\triangle OPQ$ is isosceles, so 
 $$\angle OQP = \angle OPQ = 2\alpha.$$
 Therefore $\angle QOP = \pi - 4\alpha$. Since $\angle ROQ + \angle QOP + \theta = \pi,$ $\alpha + (\pi - 4 \alpha) + \theta = \pi$, so $\theta = 3\alpha$,
 $$\angle PRO = \frac{\theta}{3}.$$
\end{proof}


\paragraph{Ex. 10.3.13}

{\it According to [15] (G.E.Martin, Geometric Constructions), Pappus used a marked ruler to trisect angles as follows. Given an angle $0<\theta < \pi/2$, write it as $\theta = \angle POA$, where:
\be
\item[$\bullet$] The distance between $P$ and $O$ is $1/2$.
\item[$\bullet$] The line $l_1$ determined by $P$ and $A$ is perpendicular to the line determined by $O$ and $A$.
\ee
Any angle $0 < \theta < \pi/2$ can be put in this form by a marked-ruler construction. Finally, let $l_2$ be the line through $P$ that is perpendicular to $l_1$. Then verging with $O$ and the lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ gives points $Q \in l_1$ and $R \in l_2$ such that $Q$ and $R$ are one unit apart.

Prove that $\angle QOA = \theta/3$.
}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10.8cm,height=11.4cm]{markedRulers5.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
As $OP = \frac{1}{2}$, $P = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos \theta, \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \right)$, and $A = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos \theta,0 \right)$. The vertical line is not a solution. The equation of every nonvertical line  $l$ with slope $m$ passing through $Q$ is $$l : y = mx,$$ where $m = \tan \alpha$ and $\alpha\in ] -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}[$ is a measure of $\angle AOR$.
The equations of $l_1,l_2$ are 
\begin{align*}
l_1  &: x = \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta,\\
l_2 &: y = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta.
\end{align*}
The intersection point $Q = (x_1,y_1)$ of $l$ with $l_1$ is given by
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta,\\
y_1 &= m \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta,
\end{align*}
and the intersection point $R$ of $l$ with $l_2$ is given by
\begin{align*}
x_2 &= \frac{1}{2m} \sin \theta,\\
y_2 & = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
QR = 1 &\iff 1 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\\
&\iff 1 = \left ( \frac{1}{2m} \sin \theta -  \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta - m \frac{1}{2} \cos \theta\right)^2\\
&\iff 1 = \frac{1}{4m^2} (sin \theta - m \cos \theta)^2 + \frac{1}{4} (\sin \theta - m \cos \theta)^2\\
&\iff 4 m^2  = (sin \theta - m \cos \theta)^2(m^2+1)\\
&\iff 0 = \left (\sin \theta - m \cos \theta - \frac{2m}{\sqrt{m^2+1}}\right )\left (\sin \theta - m \cos \theta + \frac{2m}{\sqrt{m^2+1}}\right) 
\end{align*}
Note that, since $m = \tan \alpha$,
$$ \frac{2m}{\sqrt{m^2+1}} = \frac{2 \, \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha}} {\sqrt{\frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} + 1}}  = 2 \sin \alpha.$$
Moreover 
$$\sin \theta - m \cos \theta = \sin \theta - \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha} \cos \theta = \frac{\sin(\theta - \alpha)}{\cos \alpha}.$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
 QR = 1 &\iff 0 = \left (\frac{\sin(\theta - \alpha)}{\cos \alpha} - 2 \sin \alpha \right) \left (\frac{\sin(\theta - \alpha)}{\cos \alpha} + 2 \sin \alpha \right)\\
 &\iff 0 = (\sin(\theta - \alpha) - \sin (2\alpha))(\sin(\theta - \alpha) + \sin (2\alpha))\\
 &\iff \sin(\theta - \alpha) =  \pm \sin (2\alpha)\\
 &\iff \theta -\alpha = 2 \alpha - k \pi  \quad \mathrm{or} \quad \theta - \alpha =  \pi - 2 \alpha + k \pi \qquad (k\in \Z)\\
 &\iff \alpha = \frac{\theta}{3} + k \frac{\pi}{3} \quad \mathrm{or} \quad \alpha = \pi - \theta + k \pi  \qquad (k \in \Z).
\end{align*}
Since $0 <\theta  < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2} < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}$, we obtain finally
$$QR = 1 \iff \alpha = \frac{\theta}{3} \quad \mathrm{or} \quad \alpha = \frac{\theta + \pi}{3}  \quad \mathrm{or} \quad \alpha = \frac{\theta - \pi}{3} \quad \mathrm{or} \quad  \alpha = -\theta .$$

The only solution $0 < \alpha < \theta$ is $\alpha = \theta/3$.

In the example of the angle $\theta = 60¡ = \pi/3$, where $\theta/3 = 20¡ = \pi/9$ is not constructible by straightedge and compass, we obtain $\alpha \in \left \{ \frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{4\pi}{9},-\frac{2\pi}{9}, - \frac{\pi}{3}\right \}$, all constructible with the marked ruler (see figure).
\end{proof}

\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
We follow the indication of David A. Cox and give the more geometric proof of [15] (G.E.Martin, Geometric Constructions):

"Let $\angle AOR$ have measure $t$. Then $\angle PRO$ has measure $t$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $Q$ and $R$. Since $\angle RPQ$ is right, then $P$ lies on the circle with diameter $\overline{RQ}$ by the converse of the Theorem of Thales. So $MQ = MP = MR = OP = 1/2$, and $\triangle MPR$ and $\triangle POM$ are isosceles triangles. Hence, $\angle MPR$ has measure $t$ by the Pons Asinorum, $\angle OMP$ has measure $2t$ by the Exterior Angle Theorem, and $\angle POM$ has measure $2t$ by the Pons Asinorum. Therefore, $\overrightarrow{OR}$ trisects $\angle POA$."
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Ex. 10.3.14}

{\it As explained in [21](C.R.Videla, {\it On points constructible from conics}), Pappus used intersections of conics to trisect angles as follows. Consider the unit circle centered at the origin, and let $0<\theta < \pi/2$. Then $P = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$ is the corresponding point on the unit circle. We assume that $P$ is known. Also let $O =(0,0)$ and set $A = (1,0)$. Thus $\theta = \angle POA$.
\be
\item[(a)] Consider the curve $C$ consisting of all points $Q = (x,y)$ such that the distance from $P$ to $Q$ is twice the distance from $Q$ to the $y$-axis. The curve $C$ intersects the unit circle at a point $R$ lying in the interior of $\angle POA$. Prove that $\angle ROA = \theta/3$.
\item[(b)] Show that the curve $C$ is a hyperbola. It follows that we have trisected an angle using the intersection of a hyperbola and a circle, i.e., an intersection of conics.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)]
Let $H$ the orthogonal projection of $R$ on the $x$-axis, and $S$ such that $H$ is the midpoint  of $RS$, so $S$ is the reflection of $R$ with regard to the $x$-axis. Since $R$ is on the curve $C$,
$$PR = 2 RA = RS,$$
therefore the measures of $\angle ROP$ and $\angle SOR$ are equal, and is twice the measure of $\angle AOP$, so $\overrightarrow{OR}$ trisects the angle $\angle POA$ and a measure of $\angle ROA$ is $\theta/3$.

\item[(b)] Let $Q=(x,y), H = (x,0), P = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$
\begin{align*}
Q \in C &\iff QP = 2 QH \iff QP^2 = 4 QH^2\\
&\iff(x- \cos \theta)^2 + (y-\sin \theta)^2 = 4 y^2\\
& \iff x^2 - 3 y^2  - 2 x \cos \theta  - 2 y \sin \theta +1 = 0
\end{align*}
The discriminant of the quadratic form $a x^2 + bxy + cy^2 = x^2-3y^2$ is $\Delta = 12>0$, so $C$ is not empty and $C$ is a hyperbola.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12cm,height=8cm]{Nicomedes.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
\item[(a)] We suppose that $k\geq 0$. Let $I$ be the midpoint of $AB$. As $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, by Pythagoras' Theorem, $CI^2 + (k/8)^2 = AC^2 = 1$,  therefore $0 \leq k/8\leq1$, so $k \leq 8$. If $k>8$, there exists no point $C$ with the conditions of the text. If $k=8$, $C$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and $l_1$ = $l_2$, and if $k=0$, $A=B$ and $l_2$ is not defined. The restriction $0<k<8$ is necessary.

\item[(b)] 2 solutions.

\be

	\item[{\bf Solution 1.}]  Personal solution with analytic geometry.
	
	Take the origin in $O = M$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, and take $MB,MC$ as the $x$ and $y$-axis. Write for simplicity $\lambda = MB = k/8, \mu = MC$, so $\lambda^2 + \mu^2 = 1$. The unknown is $x = \overline{BR}$.
	
	The coordinates of $A,B,C,D,R$ are
$$ A \left | 
\begin{array}{c}
  -\lambda\\
 0 
\end{array}
\right.
, \quad 
B \left | 
\begin{array}{c}
  \lambda\\
 0 
\end{array}
\right.

C \left | 
\begin{array}{c}
 0\\
\mu
\end{array}

  -2\lambda\\
-\mu
\end{array}
\right.
, \quad 
R \left | 
\begin{array}{c}
  \lambda + x\\
 0 
\end{array}
\right.
.
$$	
Let $M = (X,Y)$ a point.
\begin{align*}
(X,Y) \in l_1 = (DB) &\iff 0 = \begin{vmatrix} X - x_B & x_B - x_D \\Y-y_B & y_B - y_D \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} X - \lambda & 3 \lambda \\Y&\mu \end{vmatrix}\\
	&\iff \mu X +(\lambda+x) Y = 0.\\
\end{align*}
So the equation of $(DB)$ is
$$(DB) : \mu x +(\lambda + x) Y =\mu(\lambda + x).$$
Similarly,
\begin{align*}
(X,Y) \in (CR) &\iff 0 = \begin{vmatrix} X - x_C & -(x_R - x_C) \\Y-y_C &-(y_R-y_C) \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} X  & -( \lambda +x)\\Y - \mu &\mu \end{vmatrix}\\
	&\iff \mu(X-\lambda) - 3\lambda = 0.\\
\end{align*}
So the equation of $(CR)$ is
$$(CR) : \mu x - 3 \lambda Y = \lambda \mu.$$
The coordinates $(x_Q,y_Q)$ are given by the system
\begin{align*}
\mu X - 3 \lambda Y &= \lambda \mu\\
\mu X + (\lambda + x) Y &= \mu (\lambda +X)
\end{align*}
Since $\mu \ne 0$, this is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
(4\lambda + x) X &= 4\lambda(\lambda + x)\\
(4\lambda + x) Y &= \mu x,
\end{align*}
so
$$ Q\left | 
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{4 \lambda (\lambda + x)}{4\lambda +x}\\
\frac{\mu x}{4\lambda +x}
\end{array}
\right.
, \quad 
R \left | 
\begin{array}{c}
  \lambda + x\\
 0 
\end{array}
\right.
.
$$
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
QR = 1 &\iff \left [ \frac{4 \lambda (\lambda + x)}{4\lambda +x} - (\lambda + x) \right ]^2 + \left [ \frac{\mu x}{4\lambda +x} \right]^2\\
&\iff (4 \lambda + x)^2 = (\lambda + x)^2 x^2 + \mu^2 x^2\\
&\phantom{\iff (4 \lambda + x)^2\, } = x^4+ 2\lambda x^3 +( \lambda^2 + \mu ^2) x^2\\
&\phantom{\iff (4 \lambda + x)^2\, } = x^4 + 2 \lambda x^3 + x^2\\
&\iff x^4 + 2\lambda x^3 - 8 \lambda x - 16 \lambda^2 = 0\\
& \iff (x+ 2 \lambda)(x^3 - 8 \lambda) = 0\\
&\iff \left (x+ \frac{k}{4} \right)(x^3 - k)=0
\end{align*}

As $Q \ne D, R \ne A$, so $x \ne -k/4$. Therefore
$$QR = 1 \iff x = \sqrt[3]{k}.$$
Note: the factorization is easy because $x = -2 \lambda = -k/4$ gives the particular solution $R = A$.

The marked-ruler constructions of Pappus (for the trisection) and Nicomedes (for the cube root) give both a fourth degree equation with a known obvious solution.

	\item[{\bf Solution2.}]  From  [15] (G.E. Martin, Geometric Constructions):

" Let the parallel to $(AB)$ that passes through $C$ intersect $(DB)$ at $E$. So $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle CDE$ are similar. Then, since $A$ bisects $CD$, we have $CE = 2 AB = k/2$. Also, since $\triangle QBR$ and $\triangle QCE$ are similar, we have $(k/2) / CQ = BR/1$. With $x = BR$, then $CQ = k/(2x)$. With $M$ the midpoint of $A$ and $B$, by two aplications of the Pythagorean Theorem, we now have
\begin{align*}
\left ( 1 + \frac{k}{2x} \right )^2 &= CR^2 = CM^2+MR^2 = (CA^2 - AM^2) + MR^2\\
&=1^2 - \left ( \frac{k}{8} \right)^2  + \left( x + \frac{k}{8}\right)^2
\end{align*}
(So, multiplying the two members by $8^2x^2$,
\begin{align*}
16(2x+k)^2 &= 8^2x^2 - k^2x^2 +x^2(8x+k)^2\\
64 x^2 + 64 kx + 16 k^2 &= 64 x^2 - k^2 x^2 + 64 x^4 + 16kx^3 + k^2 x^2\\
0 &= 64x^4 + 16kx^3 -64kx - 16k^2\\
0 &=4x^4 + kx^3 - 4kx -k^2. )
\end{align*}
Fortunately, this quartic easily factors as $(4x+k)(x^3-k) =0$. Since $4x+k>0$, then we must have $x^3 -k =0$. Therefore, $x$ is the real cube root of $k$, as desired."
\ee
\item[(c)]If $k$ is any positive number, let $s$ an integer such that $0 < k <2^{3s+3}$, so $0 < K <8$, where $K = \frac{k}{2^{3s}}$. The Nicomedes' construction applied to $K$ gives $\sqrt[3]{K}$, thus $\sqrt[3]{k} = 2^s \sqrt[3]{K}$ is constructible by marked-ruler.

{\it Let $P$ be a point distance $b>0$ from a line $l$. Put a marked ruler though $P$ with one mark at $R \in l$. When $R$ moves along $l$, the other mark $Q_1$ or $Q_2$ (depending on which side of $l$ it is on) traces out the conchoid of Nicomedes.

We can relate the conchoid to constructions problems as follows.
\be
\item[(a)] Suppose we are given a point $P$ and lines $l_1,l_2$, and assume that $P \not \in l_1$. Prove that a point $Q$ is obtained by verging with $P$ and $l_1,l_2$ if and only if $Q$ is one of the points of intersection of $l_2$ with the conchoid determined by $P$ and $l_1$.
\item[(b)] Prove that the angle trisection of (10.18) can be interpreted as the intersection of the unit circle with the conchoid determined by $P$ and $l_1$.

\item[(c)] Suppose that $P = (0,0)$ and $l$ is the horizontal line $y=-b$. Prove that the polar equation of the conchoid is
$$r = b \csc \theta \pm 1,$$
where the minus sign gives the portion of the curve above $l$ and the plus sign gives the portion below.
\item[(d)] Under the assumptions of part (c), show that the Cartesian equation of the conchoid is
$$(x^2+y^2)(y-b)^2 = y^2.$$
By part (a), verging is the same as intersecting the conchoid with a line. Since the above equation has degree 4, this explains why verging leads to an equation of degree 4.
\ee
}

\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)] Let $Q \in l_2$. Then $Q$ is obtained by verging with $P$ and $l_1,l_2$ if and only if there is a point $R \in l_1$ such that $QR = 1$, if and only if $R$ is on the conchoid.

\item[(b)] As $QR=1$, with $R$ on $l$, $Q$ is on the conchoid determined by $P$ and $l$, and on the unit circle, so $Q$ is at the intersection of the unit circle and the conchoid.

\item[(c)] Here $P = (0,0)$ and $l$ is the horizontal line $y=-b$, in the Cartesian coordinates system $(P,\vec{e}_1,\vec{e}_2)$.   

If $R$ is any point on $l$, then $\overrightarrow{PR} = \rho  \vec{u}$, where $\vec{u} = \cos \theta \, \vec{e}_1 + \sin \theta\,  \vec{e}_2, \ 0  <\theta < \pi$, and $\rho = PM>0$. The equation of the line $l_R = (PR)$ is 
$$x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta=0,$$
thus $$ R = \left(-b\, \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}, -b\right).$$
If $C$ is the conchoid, and $Q = (x,y) = (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta), \ r>0, 0 < \theta < \pi$ any point of the line $l_R$, then
\begin{align*}
Q \in  C & \iff  QR = 1\\
&\iff 1 =    \left(x + b\, \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \right)^2 + (y + b)^2\\
&\iff \left ( r \cos \theta + b \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \right)^2 + (r \sin \theta + b)^2 = 1\\
&\iff \left ( r + \frac{b}{\sin \theta} \right)^2 = 1\\
&\iff  r = \frac{-b}{\sin \theta}   \pm 1 \quad ( = -b \csc \theta \pm 1).
\end{align*}
 So the polar equation of the conchoid of Nicomedes is
  $$r = \frac{-b}{\sin \theta}   \pm 1, \qquad 0 < \theta < \pi,$$
where the sign gives the two portions of the curve.

\item[(c)]
Any non horizontal line $l_1$ has an equation $x = py$, where $p = 0$ or $p = 1/m$, $m$ being the slope of $l_1$.
The intersection point $R$ of $l$ with $l_1$ is $R = (-pb,-b)$, so 
\begin{align*}
Q \in C &\iff \exists p \in \R,\ Q \in l_1 \quad \mathrm{and} \quad QR = 1\\
&\iff \exists p \in \R,\quad 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ccl}
  x&  = &  py \\
  1& = &(x + pb)^2 + (y +b)^2 
\end{array}
\right.\\
&\iff (x,y) = (0,0)\  \mathrm{or} \ \left ( x + b \frac{x}{y} \right)^2 + (y+b)^2 = 1\\
&\iff x^2(y+b)^2 + y^2(y+b)^2 = y^2\\
&\iff (x^2 + y^2)(y+b)^2 = y^2
\end{align*}
(The polar equation gives the same Cartesian equation. For $r\ne 0$, 
\begin{align*}
\left (r + \frac{b}{\sin \theta} \right)^2 = 1 &\iff (y + b)^2 = \sin^2 \theta = \frac{y^2}{r^2}\\
&\iff (x^2 +y^2)(y+b)^2 = y^2.)
\end{align*}
The sign $-$ in the text seems to be a misprint, if the equation of $l$ is $y = -b$ (correct if the equation of $l$ is $y=b$).

{\it Let $P$ a point on a circle, and consider a marked ruler that goes through $P$. If we place one mark on a point $Q$ on the circle, then the other mark $R_1$ or $R_2$ traces out a curve called the limaon of Pascal.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6.5cm,height=8cm]{limacon.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
\be
\item[(a)]  As $QR = 1$, where $Q \in C$ and $R$ is on the line $(PQ)$, $R\in l$ is by definition on the limaon determined by $P$ and $C$,

\item[(b)] Let $l_1 : y = mx$ be any nonvertical line passing through $P = (0,0)$, with $m = \tan \theta, \ -\pi / 2 <\theta < \pi/2$, so the measure of the angle between the $x$-axis and $l_1$ is $\theta$.  Let $Q =(x_Q,y_Q),Q \ne P$ be the intersection point of $l_1$ with $C$. Then $x_Q \ne 0$.

$(x_Q,y_Q)$ is solution of the system
\begin{align*}
y &= mx\\
a^2 &=(x-a)^2 + y^2 
\end{align*}
which gives $$y_Q = mx_Q,\qquad 0 = x_Q\, [(m^2+1)x_Q - 2a],$$ with $x_Q \ne 0$, so
$$Q = \left(\frac{2a}{m^2+1}, \frac{2am}{m^2+1}\right).$$
Since $m = \tan \theta$,
$$ Q = (2a \cos^2 \theta, 2a \sin \theta \cos \theta) = (a (\cos(2\theta)+1), a \sin(2\theta)).$$
Let $R = (r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)$ any point of $l_1$.
Then $R$ is on the limaon determined by $C$ and $P$ if and only if $QR = 1$ (by continuity, the points at distance 1 on the vertical tangent to the circle at point $P$ are considered to be on the limaon):
\begin{align*}
QR = 1 &\iff 1 = (r \cos \theta - 2a \cos^2 \theta)^2 + (r \sin \theta  - 2 a \sin \theta \cos \theta)^2\\
&\iff 1 = (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta)(r - 2 a \cos \theta)^2\\
&\iff 1 =(r - 2 a \cos \theta)^2\\
&\iff r = 1 + 2a \cos \theta \quad \mathrm{or} \quad r = -1 + 2a \cos \theta
\end{align*}
\ee
This can be interpreted geometrically. Let $P,A$ the intersection points of $C$ with the $x$-axis. As $PA$ is a diameter of $C$, the angle $\angle PQR$ is a right angle, so $PQ = 2a \cos \theta$. Therefore $PR = | PQ \pm 1| = |\pm 1 + 2a \cos \theta|$.

The limaon is the union of the curves $C_1,C_2$ with polar equations
$$ r = 1 + 2a \cos \theta, \qquad  r = -1 + 2a \cos \theta, \qquad -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}.$$
As $\cos(\theta + \pi) = - \cos(\theta)$, if the point $R$ with polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ is on $C_1$, then $(-r, \theta + \pi)$ is on $C_2$. But $(r,\theta)$ and  $(-r,\theta + \pi)$ are polar coordinates of the same point!  Therefore the two curves are identical if we let $\theta$ vary in $\R$, and we obtain the complete curve if we let $\theta$ vary in $]-\pi,\pi]$ in the equation of $C_1$.

The limaon determined by $P$ and $C$ has polar equation
$$r = 1 + 2a \cos \theta, \qquad \theta \in \R.$$

\item[(c)] Let $L$ the limaon. By part (b), if $x \ne 0$
\begin{align*}
(x,y) \in L &\iff \exists m \in \R, 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ccl}
 y & =   & mx  \\
 1 & =  &   \left(x - \frac{2a}{m^2 + 1}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{2am}{m^2+1}\right) \\
\end{array}
\right.\\
 &\iff 1  =    \left(x - \frac{2a}{\frac{x^2}{y^2} + 1}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{2a\frac{x}{y}}{\frac{x^2}{y^2}+1}\right) \\
 &\iff x^2(x^2+y^2-2ax)^2 + y^2 (x^2+y^2-2ax)^2 = (x^2+y^2)^2\\
 &\iff (x^2 + y^2 -2ax)^2 = x^2+y^2
\end{align*}

The two exceptional points $(0,\pm1)$ satisfy this equation, so the Cartesian equation of the limaon is
$$L : (x^2 + y^2 -2ax)^2 = x^2+y^2.$$
(We can also obtain this equation from the polar equation $r = 1 + 2a \cos \theta$.)

{\it A Pierpont prime is a prime $p>3$ of the form $p=2^k 3^l+1$. Prove that a regular $n$-gon can be constructed by origami (or by marked ruler or by intersections of conics) if and only if $n = 2^a 3^b p_1 \cdots p_s$ where $a,b\geq 0$ and $p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are distinct Pierpont primes. 
}

\begin{proof}
A regular $n$-gon can be constructed by origami if and only if $\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i/n}$ is an origami number (see Exercise 10.1.2, where the figures constructible by straightedge and compass are a fortiori constructible by origami). 

The splitting field of $\zeta_n$ over $\Q$ is $\Q(\zeta_n)$.
By Theorem 10.3.6, $\zeta_n$ is an origami number if and only if $[\Q(\zeta_n):\Q] = 2^a 3 ^b$ for some integers $a,b \geq 0$, and the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_n$ over $\Q$ is $\Phi_n(x)$, so $[\Q(\zeta_n):\Q]  = \deg(\Phi_n) = \phi(n)$, so
$$\zeta_n \in {\cal O} \iff \phi(n)=2^a 3^b,\ a,b \in \N.$$
\be
\item[$\bullet$] First suppose that $n=2^u3^v p_1\cdots p_s, \ u,v \geq 0$, where $p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are distinct Pierpont numbers.

Write $p_k = 2^{u_k}3^{v_k}+1, \ u_k, v_k \in \N$, for $k=1,\ldots,s$. As $2^u, 3^v, p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are relatively prime, if $u\geq 1,v \geq 1$ 
\begin{align*}
\phi(n) &= \phi(2^u) \phi(3^v) \phi(p_1)\cdots \phi(p_s) \\
	&=  (2^a - 2^{a-1}) (3^b - 3^{b-1}) (p_1-1)\cdots(p_s-1)\\
	&= 2^{a-1} ( 2 \times 3^{b-1}) (2^{u_1}3^{v_1}) \cdots (2^{u_s}3^{v_s})\\
	&= 2^a 3^b,\qquad a,b \in \N.
\end{align*}
If $u=0$, $\phi(2^u) = 1$, and if $v=0$, $\phi(3^v) = 1$. In all cases,
$$ \phi(n)=2^a 3^b,\quad a,b \in \N.$$

\item[$\bullet$] Conversely, suppose that $\phi(n)=2^a 3^b,\ a,b \geq 0$, and let the factorization of $n$ be $n = q_1^{a_1}\cdots q_s^{a_s}$, where $q_1,\ldots,q_s$ are distinct primes and the exponents $a_1,\ldots, a_s$ are all $\geq 1$. Then
$$\phi(n) = 2^a 3^b = q_1^{a_1-1}(q_1-1)\cdots q_s^{a_s-1}(q_s-1).$$
If $a_i > 1$, then $q_i \mid 2^a 3^b$, so $q_i = 2$, or $q_i=3$, and $q_i^{a_i}$ is a power of $2$ or $3$.

If $a_i=1$, then $q_i-1 \mid 2^a 3^b$, therefore $q_i - 1 = 2^{u_i} 3^{v_i}$, and so $q_i$ is a Piermont prime number, and $q_i^{a_i} = q_i =2^{u_i} 3^{v_i}+1$.

So $n = 2^a 3^b p_1 \cdots p_s$ where $a,b\geq 0$ and $p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are distinct Pierpont primes.

Conclusion: a regular $n$-gon can be constructed by origami if and only if $n = 2^a 3^b p_1 \cdots p_s$ where $a,b\geq 0$ and $p_1,\ldots,p_s$ are distinct Pierpont primes.
